# Red Hat Trusted Profile Analyzer Ansible collection

The purpose of this Ansible collection is to automate the deployment of the Red Hat Trusted Profile Analyzer (RHTPA) service on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL).

> [!IMPORTANT]
Deploying RHTPA by using Ansible is a Technology Preview feature only.
Technology Preview features are not supported with Red Hat production service level agreements (SLAs), might not be functionally complete, and Red Hat does not recommend to use them for production.
These features provide early access to upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process.
See the support scope for [Red Hat Technology Preview](https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview/) features for more details.


## Description

The RHTPA service is the downstream redistribution of the [Trustification](https://github.com/trustification/trustification) project.
The automation contained within this Git repository installs and configures the components of RHTPA to run on a single RHEL server by using a standalone containerized deployment. A Kubernetes-based manifest creates containers that uses [`podman kube play`](https://docs.podman.io/en/latest/markdown/podman-kube-play.1.html).

The RHTPA Ansible collection deploys the following RHTPA components:

- [Trustification](https://github.com/trustification/trustification)
- [Guac](https://github.com/trustification/guac)

An [NGINX](https://www.nginx.com) front end places an entrypoint to the RHTPA UI.

## Prerequisites

A RHEL 9.3+ server should be used to run the Trustification components.

Install and configure Ansible on a control node before performing the automated deployment.

## Minimum hardware requirements 
* 24 vCPU, 
* 48 GB Ram, 
* 100 GB Disk space 

## Requirements

* Ansible 2.16.0 or greater
* Python 3.10.0 or greater
* RHEL x86\_64 9.3 or greater.
* Installation and configuration of Ansible on a control node to perform the automation.

You must provide the following external services:

* An OpenID Connect (OIDC) provider, such [RedHat Single Sign On](https://console.redhat.com/ansible/automation-hub/repo/published/redhat/sso/) or Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cognito.
* Simple Queue Service (SQS), for example, [Red Hat AMQ Streams](https://console.redhat.com/ansible/automation-hub/repo/published/redhat/amq_streams/)
* A new PostgreSQL database.
* AWS Simple Storage Service (S3) or an S3-compatible service, for example, MinIO.

## External Services Configurations

### RedHat Single Sign On

* [Trustification Keycloak](https://github.com/trustification/trustification/blob/release/1.2.z/docs/modules/admin/pages/cluster-preparing.adoc#keycloak)


### RedHat Kafka streams  
  With the following topic names created:
```
  bombastic-failed-default
  bombastic-indexed-default
  bombastic-stored-default
  vexination-failed-default
  vexination-indexed-default
  vexination-stored-default
  v11y-failed-default
  v11y-indexed-default
  v11y-stored-default
```

Configure these topic names in the `roles/tpa_single_node/vars/main.yml` file.

* [Trustification event queues](https://github.com/trustification/trustification/blob/release/1.2.z/docs/modules/admin/pages/cluster-preparing.adoc#event-queues)

### Postgresql

Create a PostgreSQL database and configure your database credentials in the  environment variables, see 'Verifying the deployment section', 
other database configurations are in the roles/tpa_single_node/vars/main.yml

Postgres ssl mode is enabled by default. To disable SSL, change the following line in the `roles/tpa_single_node/vars/main.yml` file.
`tpa_single_node_pg_ssl_mode: disable`.

* [Trustification-PostgreSQL](https://github.com/trustification/trustification/blob/release/1.2.z/docs/modules/admin/pages/cluster-preparing.adoc#rds)


### S3 or S3 compatible service
  Have the following unversioned S3 bucket names created:
  ```
  bombastic-default
  vexination-default
  v11y-default 
  ```
Configure these S3 bucket names in the `roles/tpa_single_node/vars/main.yml` file.

* [Trustification S3](https://github.com/trustification/trustification/blob/release/1.2.z/docs/modules/admin/pages/cluster-preparing.adoc#s3-storage)


Utilize the steps below to understand how to setup and execute the provisioning.

## Configurations on the controller node

On the controller node export the following environment variables:

1. Export the following environment variables, replacing the placeholders with your relevant information:

   ```shell
      export TPA_SINGLE_NODE_REGISTRY_USERNAME=<Your Red Hat image registry username>
      export TPA_SINGLE_NODE_REGISTRY_PASSWORD=<Your Red Hat image registry password>
      export TPA_PG_HOST=<POSTGRES HOST IP>
      export TPA_PG_ADMIN=<DB ADMIN>
      export TPA_PG_ADMIN_PASSWORD=<DB ADMIN PASSWORD>
      export TPA_PG_USER=<DB USER>
      export TPA_PG_USER_PASSWORD=<DB PASSWORD>
      export TPA_STORAGE_ACCESS_KEY=<Storage Access Key>
      export TPA_STORAGE_SECRET_KEY=<Storage Secret Key>
      export TPA_OIDC_ISSUER_URL=<AWS Cognito or Keycloak Issuer URL. Incase of Keycloak endpoint auth/realms/chicken is needed>
      export TPA_OIDC_FRONTEND_ID=<OIDC Frontend Id>
      export TPA_OIDC_PROVIDER_CLIENT_ID=<OIDC Walker Id>
      export TPA_OIDC_PROVIDER_CLIENT_SECRET=<OIDC Walker Secret>
      export TPA_EVENT_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<Kafka Username or AWS SQS Access Key>
      export TPA_EVENT_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<Kafka User Password or AWS SQS Secret Key>
   ```
   
2. Choose between AWS S3 or an S3-compatible service, and update the `roles/tpa_single_node/defaults/main.yml` file accordingly.

3. Choose between Keycloak or AWS Cognito, and update the `roles/tpa_single_node/defaults/main.yml` file accordingly.

4. In case of Minio, create environmental variable for storage endpoint
```shell
export TPA_STORAGE_ENDPOINT = <Minio storage URL >
```

5. For Kafka events, create an environment variable pointing to the bootstrap server:
```shell
export TPA_EVENT_BOOTSTRAP_SERVER=<Kafka Bootstrap Server>
```

6. If you are using AWS Cognito as your OIDC provider, then create an environment variable pointing to the Cognito domain:
```shell
export TPA_OIDC_COGNITO_DOMAIN=<AWS Cognito Domain>
```

## Provision

In order to deploy Trustification on a RHEL 9.3+ VM:

1. Update the content of the `inventory.ini` file in the project:

```
[trustification]
<IP_TARGET_MACHINE>

[trustification:vars]
ansible_user=<username>
ansible_ssh_pass=<ssh_password>
ansible_private_key_file=<path to private key>
```

2. Configure if needed the `ansible.cfg` file in the project:

```
[defaults]
inventory = ./inventory.ini
host_key_checking = 
```


3. Path for TLS certificates files:

Copy your certificate files in `certs/` directory using following names:

- trust-cert.crt
- trust-cert.key
- rootCA.crt

Optionally, the certs directory variable `tpa_single_node_certificates_dir` under `roles/tpa_single_node/vars/main.yml` file can also be updated with a directory certs for below variables:

- tpa_single_node_root_ca

- tpa_single_node_trust_cert_tls_crt_path
- tpa_single_node_trust_cert_tls_key_path
- tpa_single_node_nginx_tls_crt_path
- tpa_single_node_nginx_tls_key_path


4. Update the `roles/tpa_single_node/vars/main.yml` file with these values:

- Storage Service:

  1. Update the Storage type, either `s3` or `minio`
  2. Update the S3/Minio bucket names
  3. Update the AWS region for AWS S3 or keep `us-west-1` for minio
  4. In case of minio, update minio storage end point `tpa_single_node_storage_endpoint`

- SQS Service:
  1. Update the Event bus type, either `kafka` or `sqs`
  2. Update the topics for each events
  3. In case of Kafka, update the fields `tpa_single_node_kafka_security_protocol` and `tpa_single_node_kafka_auth_mechanism`
  4. In case of AWS SQS, update the AWS SQS region `tpa_single_node_sqs_region`

Refer `roles/tpa_single_node/vars/main_example_aws.yml` and `roles/tpa_single_node/vars/main_example_nonaws.yml`
