# Red Hat Trusted Profile Analyzer Ansible collection

The purpose of this Ansible collection is to automate the deployment of the Red Hat Trusted Profile Analyzer (RHTPA) service on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL).

**IMPORTANT:**
Deploying RHTPA by using Ansible is a Technology Preview feature only.
Technology Preview features are not supported with Red Hat production service level agreements (SLAs), might not be functionally complete, and Red Hat does not recommend to use them for production.
These features give early access to upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and give feedback during the development process.
See the support scope for [Red Hat Technology Preview](https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview/) features for more details.

## Description

The RHTPA service is the downstream redistribution of the [Trustification](https://github.com/trustification/trustification) project.
The automation contained within this Git repository installs and configures the components of RHTPA to run on a single RHEL server by using a standalone containerized deployment. A Kubernetes-based manifest creates containers that uses [`podman kube play`](https://docs.podman.io/en/latest/markdown/podman-kube-play.1.html).

The RHTPA Ansible collection deploys the following RHTPA components:

- [Trustification](https://github.com/trustification/trustification)
- [Guac](https://github.com/trustification/guac)

An [NGINX](https://www.nginx.com) front end places an entrypoint to the RHTPA UI.

## Minimum hardware requirements 

* 24 vCPU 
* 48 GB RAM
* 100 GB of free disk space 

## Requirements

* Ansible 2.16.0 or greater.
* Python 3.10.0 or greater.
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9.3 or greater for the x86_64 architecture.
* Installation and configuration of Ansible on a control node to perform the automation.
* External services:
    * An OpenID Connect (OIDC) provider.
    * Simple Queue Service (SQS).
    * A new PostgreSQL database.
    * AWS Simple Storage Service (S3) or an S3-compatible service, for example, MinIO.

## External services

### OIDC providers

* [Trustification Keycloak](https://github.com/trustification/trustification/blob/release/1.2.z/docs/modules/admin/pages/cluster-preparing.adoc#keycloak)
* [Red Hat Single Sign-On](https://console.redhat.com/ansible/automation-hub/repo/published/redhat/sso/)
* [Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cognito](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/getting-started-with-cognito-user-pools.html)

### SQS

* [Trustification event queues](https://github.com/trustification/trustification/blob/release/1.2.z/docs/modules/admin/pages/cluster-preparing.adoc#event-queues)
* [Red Hat AMQ Streams](https://console.redhat.com/ansible/automation-hub/repo/published/redhat/amq_streams/).

Create the following topic names before installing RHTPA:

```
bombastic-failed-default
bombastic-indexed-default
bombastic-stored-default
vexination-failed-default
vexination-indexed-default
vexination-stored-default
v11y-failed-default
v11y-indexed-default
v11y-stored-default
```

Configure these topic names in the `roles/tpa_single_node/vars/main.yml` file.

### PostgreSQL database

* [Trustification-PostgreSQL](https://github.com/trustification/trustification/blob/release/1.2.z/docs/modules/admin/pages/cluster-preparing.adoc#rds)

Create a PostgreSQL database and configure your database credentials in the environment variables.
You can use other database configurations in the `roles/tpa_single_node/vars/main.yml` file.

PostgreSQL SSL mode is enabled by default.
To disable SSL, you can change the following line in the `roles/tpa_single_node/vars/main.yml` file: `tpa_single_node_pg_ssl_mode: disable`.

### S3 or S3 compatible service

* [Trustification S3](https://github.com/trustification/trustification/blob/release/1.2.z/docs/modules/admin/pages/cluster-preparing.adoc#s3-storage)

Create the following unversioned S3 bucket names before installing RHTPA:

```
bombastic-default
vexination-default
v11y-default 
```

Configure these S3 bucket names in the `roles/tpa_single_node/vars/main.yml` file.

## Installation

The following steps guide you on how to configure, and provision RHTPA to run on Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

### Configuring the controller node

On the controller node, export the following environment variables replacing the placeholders with your relevant information:

```
export TPA_SINGLE_NODE_REGISTRY_USERNAME=<Your Red Hat image registry username>
export TPA_SINGLE_NODE_REGISTRY_PASSWORD=<Your Red Hat image registry password>
export TPA_PG_HOST=<POSTGRES HOST IP>
export TPA_PG_ADMIN=<DB ADMIN>
export TPA_PG_ADMIN_PASSWORD=<DB ADMIN PASSWORD>
export TPA_PG_USER=<DB USER>
export TPA_PG_USER_PASSWORD=<DB PASSWORD>
export TPA_STORAGE_ACCESS_KEY=<Storage Access Key>
export TPA_STORAGE_SECRET_KEY=<Storage Secret Key>
export TPA_OIDC_ISSUER_URL=<AWS Cognito or Keycloak Issuer URL. Incase of Keycloak endpoint auth/realms/chicken is needed>
export TPA_OIDC_FRONTEND_ID=<OIDC Frontend Id>
export TPA_OIDC_PROVIDER_CLIENT_ID=<OIDC Walker Id>
export TPA_OIDC_PROVIDER_CLIENT_SECRET=<OIDC Walker Secret>
export TPA_EVENT_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<Kafka Username or AWS SQS Access Key>
export TPA_EVENT_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<Kafka User Password or AWS SQS Secret Key>
```
   
Choose between AWS S3 or an S3-compatible service, and update the `roles/tpa_single_node/defaults/main.yml` file accordingly.

Choose between Keycloak or AWS Cognito, and update the `roles/tpa_single_node/defaults/main.yml` file accordingly.

In case of MinIO, create environmental variable for storage endpoint:

```
export TPA_STORAGE_ENDPOINT=<MinIO storage URL >
```

For Kafka events, create an environment variable pointing to the bootstrap server:

```
export TPA_EVENT_BOOTSTRAP_SERVER=<Kafka Bootstrap Server>
```

If you use AWS Cognito as your OIDC provider, then create an environment variable pointing to the Cognito domain:

```
export TPA_OIDC_COGNITO_DOMAIN=<AWS Cognito Domain>
```

### Updating the inventory and the playbook

To deploy RHTPA on a Red Hat Enterprise Linux version 9.3 or later do the following:

Update the content of the `inventory.ini` file in the project:

```
[trustification]
<IP_TARGET_MACHINE>

[trustification:vars]
ansible_user=<username>
ansible_ssh_pass=<ssh_password>
ansible_private_key_file=<path to private key>
```

Configure if needed the `ansible.cfg` file in the project:

```
[defaults]
inventory = ./inventory.ini
host_key_checking = 
```

Copy your certificate files into the `certs/` directory with the following names:

```
trust-cert.crt
trust-cert.key
rootCA.crt
```

Optionally, you can update the variable `tpa_single_node_certificates_dir` in the `roles/tpa_single_node/vars/main.yml` file with the `certs/` directory.
You can also give the specific certificate names for the associated variables:

```
tpa_single_node_root_ca
tpa_single_node_trust_cert_tls_crt_path
tpa_single_node_trust_cert_tls_key_path
tpa_single_node_nginx_tls_crt_path
tpa_single_node_nginx_tls_key_path
```

Update the `roles/tpa_single_node/vars/main.yml` file with the appropriate values for each service.

Storage Service:

* Update the Storage type, either `s3` or `minio`.
* Update the S3 or MinIO bucket names.
* Update the AWS region for AWS S3 or keep `us-west-1` for MinIO.
* In case of MinIO, update the MinIO storage end point `tpa_single_node_storage_endpoint`.

SQS Service:

* Update the Event bus type, either `kafka` or `sqs`.
* Update the topics for each events.
* In case of Kafka, update the fields `tpa_single_node_kafka_security_protocol` and `tpa_single_node_kafka_auth_mechanism`.
* In case of AWS SQS, update the AWS SQS region `tpa_single_node_sqs_region`.

Refer to `roles/tpa_single_node/vars/main_example_aws.yml` and `roles/tpa_single_node/vars/main_example_nonaws.yml` for more details.

### Collection installation

Option 1 : Install RHTPA by using the Ansible Galaxy command-line tool.

```
ansible-galaxy collection install redhat.trusted_profile_analyzer
```

Option 2 : Include the collection in a `requirements.yml` file by using this format:

```yaml
collections:
  - name: redhat.trusted_profile_analyzer
```

Then install RHTPA with the `ansible-galaxy collection install -r requirements.yml` command.

Option 3 : Run the Ansible playbook.

```
export ANSIBLE_ROLES_PATH="roles/" ; 
ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini play.yml -vv
```

**NOTE:** If you install any collection from Ansible Galaxy, upgrading the Ansible package is not automatically done.

To upgrade the collection to the latest available version, run the following command:

```
ansible-galaxy collection install redhat.trusted_profile_analyzer --upgrade
```

You can also install a specific version of the collection.
For example, if you need to rollback to an earlier version.

```
ansible-galaxy collection install redhat.trusted_profile_analyzer:==1.2.2
```

### Dependencies

Install the required Ansible collections by executing the following

```
ansible-galaxy collection install -r requirements.yml
```
